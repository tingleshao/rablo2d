rablo2d
=======

rablo2d is a tool for: <br/>
1. Producing 2d objects in medial representation. <br/>
2. Analyzing their relationship in multi-object context. <br/>
3. Generating data for multi-object statistics.<br/>
<br/>
In rablo2d you can play around with multiple 2d objects. Each one has a boundary that implied by a series of disks. <br/><br/>

By keeping push "Dilate" button, all the spokes will extend by a small ratio, once it intersects with other spokes, it will stop extending itself. Finally this process yields a linking structure in the spakes between objects.<br/><br/>
